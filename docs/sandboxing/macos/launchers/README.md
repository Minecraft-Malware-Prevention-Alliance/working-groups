# Launchers

To use a launcher profile you will need to select its profile and run the sandbox profile command. 
Here are the commands for the below current supported launchers

# Prism Launcher

`sandbox-exec -f /Path/To/Sandbox/minecraft-sandbox.sb /Applications/Prism\ Launcher.app/Contents/MacOS/prismlauncher`

# Reminder

All launcher profiles will likely need to be patched with the patcher. If a launcher does not need to be patched, it will be mentioned.
